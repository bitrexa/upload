                        Let's be honest&mdash;everyone's tired of new tokens. They get hyped up for days, some atmost weeks, and then they
                        launch and clog up the network for days, the listing goes down for a while, and then
                        &ldquo;investors&rdquo; see the new tokens lose most of their &ldquo;value&rdquo;. This <em>MEME</em>
                        is going to be a different one.

                    <p>
                        The PAT meme <em>transparently</em> offers investors no value, so there will be no expectation
                        of gains. No gains means no expectation, many investors will FOMO transactions, and many
                        transactions means the token skyrocket, this is all imagination <i class="ri-emotion-laugh-line"></i>&mdash;not to mention no depressing posts on

                        All measures are in place to make sure the token is secured, the smart contract is 100% verified on the scan, free of any alteration.
                        it is on avax chain, smart contract auditing is just a formal way of paying someone for report of risk to gain usres trust&hellip; right?

                    <p>
                        Also, we definitely <em>didn't</em> have any smart contract experts look at the contract before
                        we launched it. I mean, why bother? All the other tokens go through weeks of auditing and they
                        still end up with bugs and vulnerabilities in their contracts.

                        Unlike with every other toens in the market, We can guarantee here and now that the value
                        of PAT will not (in fact, can not) be ascertain at any position. Since these tokens aren't
                        worth anything to start with, there's nowhere to go but up!

In a cozy town, an old man named Henry lived happily with his beloved daughter, Lily. They shared laughter, dreams, and a bond that weathered time's storms. As years passed, Lily grew into a radiant woman, her heart filled with love for her father.</p>

<p>One wintry evening, Henry fell terribly ill, and despite the doctor's efforts, hope waned. Lily, with tears glistening in her eyes, whispered to her father, "Dad, do you remember our promise to dance together at my wedding?"</p>

<P>With a weak smile, Henry nodded. Determined, Lily set up a magical evening in their living room, soft music playing as she embraced her father, swaying gently as they danced. Memories flooded their hearts, and for that fleeting moment, time stood still. Henry's eyes shone with pride and love for his daughter.</P>

<p>As the night faded into dawn, Henry peacefully passed away, cradled in Lily's arms. Though grief lingered, so did the cherished memory of their final dance—a testament to an unbreakable bond that transcended time itself. the reality is this story was generated by chatGPT and it has nothing to do with this project <i class="ri-user-smile-line"></i>

                    <p>
                        For me i will say it is a joke&mdash;and it's 100% transparent. You're literally giving your money to
                        the internet and getting completely useless tokens in return.

                        There are no &ldquo;whitepapers,&rdquo; no &ldquo;products,&rdquo; and no &ldquo;experts.&rdquo;
                        It's just you, us, your hard-earned Avax.

                    <p class="h4">Why are you doing this?</p>
                    <p>
                        Who knows? Maybe it's because I lost money in the many MEME crash. Maybe I got inspired by the
                        guy who crowdfunded the GROK meme. Maybe I'm just way too bored and need a better hobby.

                    <p class="h4">What can I do with PAT?</p>
                    <p>
                        UET is a standard token on Avalanche-C-Chain, so you can buy it, hold it, sell it and transfer it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can buy and keep checking if the value did not increase, you sell it back! Other than that&hellip; nothing. Absolutely nothing.
                    </p>

                        (Why are you even still reading these?)

                    <hr />
                    <p class="h4">Will PAT be traded on any exchanges?</p>
                    <p>
                        That is for sure. You have <em>no idea</em> how much we hope so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, if it does get picked up by any of the major exchanges, we will start thinking of some serious usecase.

                    <p class="h4">Will there be tax for trading PAT</p>
                    <p>
                        That's a great question! there will be 1% only for buy and sell, so that we have don't hold any token for the team. No actual tokenomics, so don't ask further question.
